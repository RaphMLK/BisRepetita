# BisRepetita

BisRepetita is a game to play with other friends.
Created & developped by [RaphaÃ«l Mouloukin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rmouloukin/) from January 2025.

## Rules

At the beginning, you choose the master of the round.
This person will receive a question with different possible answers (example: Give me a title of a Harry Potter Movie).
He will answer first on the phone (hiding from other players) and each one have to give an answer.
If one or some players gave the same answer than the master, there are eliminated.

The game will continue until one remaining player who will become the winner of the round.
